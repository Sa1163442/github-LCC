LCC Issue Tracker is a Flask-based issue tracking system designed for Lincoln Community Campground (LCC). It aims to provide an efficient, secure and easy-to-manage online platform to help visitors submit issues and allow volunteers (Helpers) and administrators (Admins) to track and manage them. The system uses Python Flask as the backend framework, MySQL as the database, combined with Bootstrap and JavaScript for front-end development, and optimized responsive design to ensure a good user experience on mobile phones, tablets and desktops.

The system supports three user roles, namely Visitor, Helper and Admin, each with different access rights. Visitors can register and log in to an account, submit issues, and view and manage their submitted issues on their personal account page, including adding comments, updating personal information, uploading or deleting avatars, and changing passwords. Volunteers can not only perform all the operations of visitors, but also view all user-submitted issues, and add comments and change the status of issues (new, newly added, shelved, resolved) on the issue details page. Administrators have the highest authority. In addition to managing all issues, they can also search and view all user information, adjust user account status (activate/disable), and change user roles (guest, volunteer, or administrator) to ensure the overall management and maintenance of the system.

This system provides preset test accounts for development and testing. Visitor users can log in using visitor, volunteer users can log in using helper, and administrators can access all management functions of the system using admin. It is recommended that users change their passwords immediately after the first login to ensure account security.

The system is developed based on the Flask framework and uses MySQL as the database management system. All user passwords are stored with bcrypt hash encryption to ensure data security. In addition, the system is hosted on PythonAnywhere, supports remote access, and provides detailed database creation and data filling scripts for local deployment and testing. For specific installation, operation, and deployment steps, please refer to the detailed documentation of this repository to ensure that the environment configuration, dependency installation, and database initialization are performed according to the instructions to run the application smoothly.
